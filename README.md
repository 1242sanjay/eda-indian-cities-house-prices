[Exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

The main purpose of [EDA](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/exploratory-data-analysis) is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.

<b>There are four primary types of EDA:</b>
- <b>Univariate non-graphical:</b> This is simplest form of data analysis, where the data being analyzed consists of just one variable. Since it’s a single variable, it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships. The main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.
- <b>Univariate graphical:</b> Non-graphical methods don’t provide a full picture of the data. Graphical methods are therefore required. Common types of univariate graphics include: <br> Stem-and-leaf plots, which show all data values and the shape of the distribution.<br> Histograms, a bar plot in which each bar represents the frequency (count) or proportion (count/total count) of cases for a range of values.<br> Box plots, which graphically depict the five-number summary of minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
- <b>Multivariate nongraphical:</b> Multivariate data arises from more than one variable. Multivariate non-graphical EDA techniques generally show the relationship between two or more variables of the data through cross-tabulation or statistics.
- <b>Multivariate graphical:</b> Multivariate data uses graphics to display relationships between two or more sets of data. The most used graphic is a grouped bar plot or bar chart with each group representing one level of one of the variables and each bar within a group representing the levels of the other variable.


In this notebook we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis on [Indian Cities Housing Property Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishmathias/residential-property-price-indian-cities-dataset) from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

<b>The following steps which we will follow in this notebook :</b>
1. Downloading a dataset from kaggle
2. Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas
3. Open-ended exploratory analysis and visualization
4. Asking and answering interesting questions
5. Summarizing inferences and drawing conclusions
